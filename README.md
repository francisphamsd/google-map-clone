## My process

For this project, I purely use css, javascript vanilla, and Mapbox plugins to recreate the Google Map clone.

### Built with

- HTML, CSS
- Javascript vanilla
- Mapbox GL JS

### What I learned

I learn more about Mapbox GL JS and its plugin. How to combine it to create a complete map.

### Continued development

In the future, I might add more option to the map such as:

- More map layers
- Switch between Geocoding search function and map direction function (not both on the map at the same time)
- The above reason should make the map responsive on multiple devices

### Useful resources

- [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) - This is a doc for Mapbox GL JS. They have reference on how to set the marker and zoom the map

-[Dummy image api](https://dummyimage.com) - This api allow me to quickly add placeholder image to the component I plan to use later
